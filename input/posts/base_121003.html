<p>I've had this idea for a while,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> as a numeral system
, or more specifically using as much of the characters in the standard as
possible to represent numbers in a base of the size of that set of characters.
This is by no means usable in real life, not only because of the size (121,003
was the final number of "digits" I came up with), but because Unicode has a lot
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_characters_in_Unicode">
characters that either look similar or are the same</a>.
</p>

<p>
When making the converter, the real problem was determining the set of the
characters to use, because Unicode is complicated. To convert to my base
Unicode, I needed a list that a program could use. My first stop was the
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode Character Database</a> where I
got a XML version of the database. After wrangling with
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html">python's XML module</a>
for the first time, I finally got it to get the items after I realized I needed to
<a href="https://github.com/iguessthislldo/base_unicode/commit/372eff93006506acf9b026ebd0fa0762c7aa9424#diff-b5f3d03f1da0db1eb4bf220dfa348759R57">
include the xml namespace for the ucd</a>.
</p>

<p>
My intial critria was to ignore anything that wasn't printable (not control
characters like newline ('\n' 000A) or null ('\0' 0000)). This was expanded to
any character that doesn't have a
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Property_Invariants">name</a>.
